    One such library is Boost log.
- Identify dependencies on other libraries and cooperate on bugs.
- Add more examples and documentation.
- Inspection report outstanding issues
    Fix copyright and licence in preprocessed files for function_equal
    Fix libs/phoenix/doc/html/boostbook.css: Unlinked File
